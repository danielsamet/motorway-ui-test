# Solution

Hi there ðŸ‘‹,

I wasn't sure where to comment on my solution, so I decided to create a new `.md` file for it.

The main comments I want to make are as follows:

1. I took the liberty of updating the React side of the project to TypeScript, I hope that is okay. I just feel more
   comfortable when writing in TS, personally.
2. In terms of packages, I only added moment.js and Chakra-UI. The other dependencies are related to Chakra. 
   - I installed Chakra as I tend to use it as a base for many projects and did not notice any requirements against using a design system.
   - I installed moment.js simply for ease of use with dates.
3. Browser of choice is standard Chrome.
4. There are plenty of tasks that could be done next to improve the application. I will just list a few here, briefly:
   - An image modal when each image is clicked on
   - Displaying more information found in the image objects (json file)
   - Improved form validation response (i.e. not using the browsers built in validation messages)
   - Improved page responsiveness

Please reach out to me if you have any questions.
